## Algorithms

### [AES](https://github.com/Ankit1598/crypto-algos/tree/main/AES)

AES is an iterative rather than Feistel cipher. It is based on ‘substitution–permutation network’. It comprises of a series of linked operations, some of which involve replacing inputs by specific outputs (substitutions) and others involve shuffling bits around (permutations).


### [BlowFish](https://github.com/Ankit1598/crypto-algos/tree/main/BlowFish)

Blowfish is an encryption technique designed by Bruce Schneier in 1993 as an alternative to DES Encryption Technique. It is significantly faster than DES and provides a good encryption rate with no effective cryptanalysis technique found to date. It is one of the first, secure block cyphers not subject to any patents and hence freely available for anyone to use.

Given a plain-text message and a numeric key, cipher/de-cipher the given text using Columnar Transposition Cipher
The Columnar Transposition Cipher is a form of transposition cipher just like Rail Fence Cipher. Columnar Transposition involves writing the plaintext out in rows, and then reading the ciphertext off in columns one by one.


### [RSA](https://github.com/Ankit1598/crypto-algos/tree/main/RSA)
<br>

RSA algorithm is a public key encryption technique and is considered as the most secure way of encryption. It was invented by Rivest, Shamir and Adleman in year 1978 and hence name RSA algorithm.
Algorithm

The RSA algorithm holds the following features −

    RSA algorithm is a popular exponentiation in a finite field over integers including prime numbers.

    The integers used by this method are sufficiently large making it difficult to solve.

    There are two sets of keys in this algorithm: private key and public key.

### [SHA-1](https://github.com/Ankit1598/crypto-algos/tree/main/SHA-1)

![](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e2/SHA-1.svg/300px-SHA-1.svg.png)

SHA-1 or Secure Hash Algorithm 1 is a cryptographic hash function which takes an input and produces a 160-bit (20-byte) hash value. This hash value is known as a message digest. This message digest is usually then rendered as a hexadecimal number which is 40 digits long. It is a U.S. Federal Information Processing Standard and was designed by the United States National Security Agency.


### [Hill Cipher](https://github.com/Ankit1598/crypto-algos/tree/main/hill_cipher)
Hill cipher is a polygraphic substitution cipher based on linear algebra.Each letter is represented by a number modulo 26. Often the simple scheme A = 0, B = 1, …, Z = 25 is used, but this is not an essential feature of the cipher. To encrypt a message, each block of n letters (considered as an n-component vector) is multiplied by an invertible n × n matrix, against modulus 26. To decrypt the message, each block is multiplied by the inverse of the matrix used for encryption.

The matrix used for encryption is the cipher key, and it should be chosen randomly from the set of invertible n × n matrices (modulo 26).
